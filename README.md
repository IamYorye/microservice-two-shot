## Design

## Shoes microservice

Created a shoes model with certain attributes in the shoes microservice.  Created view functions and paths for those functions to handle certain methods such as as a "GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT".  Integrated a polling service that polls for data from the wardrobe API every 60 seconds that grabs data from that database to be used for the shoes microservice.  Integrated React for the front end that uses the shoes api, and the wardrobe api, particularly the bins api from the wardrobe api to create a SPA that handles shoes creating and storing those shoes in the shoes list database to be populated to the screen right after creation.  Integrated a delete button to delete a created shoe, using that shoes unique id as apart of the fetched url.
